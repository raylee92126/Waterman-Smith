# Waterman-Smith
Implementation of Waterman-Smith with affine gap penalty

## Dependencies
This script only uses numpy v1.21.2 and pandas v1.3.4 as package dependencies

## Installation


## Implementation
To use script, run the following in the command line:

`python hw1.py -i <input file> -s <score file> -op <output file>`

## Example
In this example, we use the sample-input.txt as the input file, blosum62.txt as our score, and create sample-output.txt as our example output from the script. This output file was generated using the following command:

`python hw1.py -i sample-input.txt -s blosum62.txt -op sample-output.txt`
